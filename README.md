> Music downloading service utilizing direct download websites.

Hachidori is a self hosted API and web service that allows
anyone to download music from one single place. The Hachidori
web service provides a convenient frontend to the API which
provides accessible music downloading for use in places
like a self hosted music server.

This project exists because I was not satisfied with public
trackers for music (especially Kpop.) as most torrents
are either dead or simply don't exist.

> **Warning** Hachidori is work in progress!
